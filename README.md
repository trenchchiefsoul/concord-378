### Homebrew

```sh
```

### Cargo

Install native audio dependencies first. On macOS with Homebrew:

```sh
```

On Fedora:

```sh
sudo dnf install opus-devel alsa-lib-devel pkgconf-pkg-config
```

On Debian or Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt install libopus-dev libasound2-dev pkg-config
```

On macOS with Homebrew:

```sh
```

```sh
```

To install without local voice playback and microphone support:

```sh
```

To install the latest unreleased version directly from the Git repository:

```sh
```

### Nix

Run without installing (requires flakes enabled):

```sh
nix run github:chojs23/concord
```

Install into your profile:

```sh
nix profile install github:chojs23/concord
```

Or add the flake as an input in your own `flake.nix`:

```nix
{
  inputs.concord.url = "github:chojs23/concord";
}
```

### GitHub Release installer


```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf  | sh
```

On Windows, use the PowerShell installer instead:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm  | iex"
```

The installer places `concord` under `$CARGO_HOME/bin`, which is usually
`~/.cargo/bin` on Unix and `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin` on Windows.


## Features

### Authentication

- **Token** : paste an existing Discord token.
- **Email / Password** : login with credentials. MFA (TOTP, SMS) is fully supported.
- **QR Code** : scan the code from the Discord mobile app.

Email and QR code logins may trigger a CAPTCHA challenge on Discord's side. We cannot solve that, so I strongly recommend using token authentication.

Tokens are saved under Concord's config directory in plain text. See the Security section below for details.

### Guilds & Channels

- Browse servers with guild folder grouping
- Navigate text channels, threads, and forum channels
- View and filter forum posts (active / archived)
- Load pinned messages per channel
- Open channel actions for pinned messages, thread lists, and mark-as-read
- Join and leave voice channels
- Highlight active voice speakers in voice channel participant rows
- Track unread messages and mention counts per channel
- Mute and unmute channels and servers
- Leave the selected server after confirmation

### Messaging

- Send, edit, and delete messages
- Upload / Download attachments
- Search messages with filters with `/`
- Use @mention autocomplete
- Use custom emoji from other servers when your account supports it
- Send custom emoji your account cannot use directly as image links when enabled
- View full message history
- Rich content display (embeds, attachments, stickers, and mentions)
- Detect URLs in message bodies and markdown links, then open them in your default browser
- Direct message shortcuts for copy, reply, edit, delete, reactions, URL opening,
  and image viewing. More message actions are available from the action menu.

#### Markdown Rendering

![Markdown rendering example](./docs/markdown-example.png)

Concord renders a practical subset of Discord-style Markdown in message bodies:

- Headings: `# H1`, `## H2`, `### H3`
- Quotes: `> quoted text`
- Bullets: `- item` and `* item`
- Inline styles: `**bold**`, `*italic*`, and `` `inline code` ``
- Fenced code blocks with optional language labels, rendered as compact boxes
- Raw URLs and markdown link destinations are underlined and can be opened from message actions

### Reactions & Polls

- View, add, and remove emoji reactions (Unicode and custom server emoji)
- Use custom emoji from other servers as reactions when your account supports it
- Browse who reacted with a specific emoji
- View and vote on polls

### Media & Images

Image rendering is powered by [ratatui-image](https://github.com/benjajaja/ratatui-image). On startup, Concord queries the terminal to detect the best available graphics protocol. Supported protocols:

- **Kitty Graphics Protocol** - Kitty, WezTerm, Ghostty, etc.
- **iTerm2 Inline Images** - iTerm2, WezTerm, mintty, etc.
- **Sixel** - foot, mlterm, xterm (if compiled with Sixel support), etc.
- **Halfblocks** (fallback) - works on any terminal, but uses block characters instead of true pixels.

If your terminal does not support any graphics protocol, images will be rendered as halfblock approximations. For the best experience, use a terminal that supports the Kitty or iTerm2 protocol.

You can toggle image viewing on or off in the configuration file. When image viewing is off, attachments and emojis will be shown as text placeholders.

### Members & Profiles

- Member list with grouping
- Presence indicators (Online, Idle, DND, Offline)
- View User profile

### Typing Indicators & Read State

- Live "user is typing..." indicators
- Unread message tracking with mention counts
- Mark server, channel as read

### Notifications

- Desktop notifications for Discord messages that pass your Discord
  notification settings
- Active channel notifications are suppressed so Concord does not notify for
  the conversation you are already viewing
- Voice join and leave notification sounds while you are connected to voice.
  You can keep the built-in tones or configure custom WAV files.

### Navigation & Keyboard shortcuts

> ⚠️ Keymap action names and default bindings may have breaking changes between releases.

All default key settings in this section can be customized. See
[Keymap options](./docs/keymap-options.md) for the config format and supported
actions.

Concord has a four-pane.
**Guilds (1)**, **Channels (2)**, **Messages (3)**, **Members (4)**

With default vim-style navigation:

| Key                                       | Action                                          |

#### Mention picker

When the @mention picker is open, use `Up` / `Down`,
`Ctrl+p` / `Ctrl+n`, `Tab`, or `Enter` to choose a mention.

#### Emoji picker

Type `:` plus at least two letters, such as `:he`, to pick Unicode, server, or
cross-server custom emoji while writing a message.

When `emojis_as_links` is enabled, custom emoji your account cannot send
directly are inserted as Discord image links instead.

To react from the composer, select a message, enter insert mode, then type
`+:`. The reaction picker opens for that message. Press `/` to search, Enter to
lock the filter, then Enter again or use a shown shortcut to react.

#### Bot commands

When the composer input starts with a slash `/`, the command suggestion popup

## Configuration

Concord options are stored under Concord's config directory. If
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set, Concord uses `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/concord/config.toml`
for app options and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/concord/keymap.toml` for key settings.
Otherwise it uses the platform config directory. The usual fallback is
`~/.config/concord/config.toml` and `~/.config/concord/keymap.toml` on Linux,
matching files under `~/Library/Application Support/concord/` on macOS, and the
roaming AppData config directory on Windows.

You can change some configuration from the in-app Options menu, and Concord saves them back
to `config.toml`. Key settings are read from `keymap.toml`.

microphone_volume = 100

# Received voice playback volume percentage, from 0 to 100.
voice_output_volume = 100
```

</details><br>

`image_preview_quality` supports these values:

- `efficient`: smaller preview requests to reduce bandwidth and memory use.
- `balanced`: default quality with bounded resource use.
- `high`: sharper resized previews using lossless quality.
- `original`: request the original source image for previews when possible.

This setting only applies to attachment, embed, and attachment viewer previews.
Avatars and custom emoji keep their separate small-image behavior.

## Performance

Concord is designed to stay lightweight in normal terminal use. In observed
typical use, it usually uses about 20-40 MB of memory.

Image-heavy screens can temporarily use more memory because compressed image
bytes need to be decoded before they can be rendered in the terminal. When many
images are loaded, memory can briefly rise to around 100-200 MB while decoding
and then drop again as work completes and caches are pruned.

To keep resource usage bounded, Concord limits media work in several places:

- Attachment previews are downloaded with an 8 MiB per-preview cap.
- Attachment downloads are capped at 64 MiB.
- Up to 4 attachment previews are fetched at once.
- Up to 2 inline image previews are decoded at once.
- Inline image previews, avatars, and custom emoji use small LRU caches.
- Image preview requests prefer resized Discord proxy URLs sized for the
  terminal instead of original full-size media when possible.
- The preview quality preset can lower preview source dimensions or opt into
  original source images. It does not change avatar or custom emoji sizing.

Message history is also cached with a per-channel limit, so long-running
sessions do not keep every message in memory forever.

## FAQ

### Can my account be blocked?

Honestly, no.

There are some path that did trigger a account block:

- Trying to **create a new DM channel and send a message to an unknown user**(meaning there was no pre-existing DM created through the Discord client) can immediately block your account temporarily.
- Some features that requires a hCapcha challenge on Discord's side.

Other features have not caused blocks in my testing.

That said, Concord is not an official Discord client. Using unofficial clients, automated user accounts, or self-bots can violate Discord's TOS, so there is always some risk. Use it at your own discretion.

### Does Concord support CAPTCHA?

No. If Discord requires a CAPTCHA during login, use token login instead.

## Security

- Tokens are stored as **plain text** in Concord's config directory. So keep that file secure and do not share it. You can use the token from that file to log in to the official Discord client, so treat it like a password.
- On Unix, the credential's parent directory is created with `0700` and the credential file with `0600` permissions.
- All concord state (config, keymap, credential, log) lives under a single `concord/` directory inside `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` when it is set, or inside the platform config directory otherwise.
- No system keychain integration yet.
