# Keymap options

> ⚠️ Keymap action names and default bindings may have breaking changes between releases.

Concord reads key settings from the `[keymap]` section in `keymap.toml`.

Example `keymap.toml`:

```toml
[keymap]
StartComposer = { keys = ["c"] }
ReplyMessage = "<leader>mr"
VoiceDeafen = "<leader>vd"
VoiceMute = "<leader>vm"
VoiceLeave = "<leader>vl"

[keymap.groups]
"<leader>v" = "Voice"

[keymap.guild_actions]
LeaveServer = { keys = ["l"], description = "leave server" }

[keymap.channel_actions]
MuteChannel = { keys = ["x"], description = "mute channel" }

[keymap.message_actions]
OpenThread = { keys = ["t"], description = "open thread" }
GoToReferencedMessage = "g"

[keymap.composer]
OpenEditor = "<C-o>"
DeletePreviousWord = "<A-backspace>"
```

There are several kinds of keymap settings:

| Config path                                                                                                 | What it controls                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[keymap] leader`                                                                                           | The key that opens the leader popup. Defaults to `Space`.                                 |
| `[keymap] <ActionName>`                                                                                     | Directly assignable UI actions such as `StartComposer`, `ReplyMessage`, and `OpenThread`. |
| `[keymap.groups]`                                                                                           | Optional titles for prefix popups, such as naming `<leader>v` as `Voice`.                 |
| `[keymap.guild_actions]`, `[keymap.channel_actions]`, `[keymap.message_actions]`, `[keymap.member_actions]` | Shortcuts shown inside focused-pane action menus opened by `OpenFocusedPaneAction`.       |
| `[keymap.composer]`                                                                                         | Shortcuts used while the message composer is open, such as editor and cursor commands.    |

`[keymap]` action values can be either a string or an object with `keys` and an
optional `description`:

```toml
[keymap]
StartComposer = "<leader>e"
ChannelSwitcher = { keys = ["<C-w>f", "<leader><C-w>"], description = "find channel" }
```

`keys` accepts one sequence or a list of sequences. Modifier chords use
Vim-style angle syntax, such as `<C-f>`, `<S-tab>`, and `<A-backspace>`.
Leader sequences like `<leader><C-w>`, compact plain sequences like `fd`, and
general multi-key prefixes like `<C-w>f` are supported. Prefix sequences show a
[which-key.nvim](https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim) style popup. For example, `fd` opens an `f` popup after `f`, then runs
the action after `d`.

Scoped action tables use the same string or object shape, but each `keys` entry
must be a single key chord. Multi-key sequences such as `gt` are only supported
by direct `[keymap]` actions, not by `[keymap.guild_actions]`,
`[keymap.channel_actions]`, `[keymap.message_actions]`, or
`[keymap.member_actions]`.

```toml
[keymap.channel_actions]
MuteChannel = { keys = ["u", "<C-u>"], description = "mute channel" }

[keymap.message_actions]
GoToReferencedMessage = { keys = ["g"], description = "go to referenced message" }
```

Composer action values under `[keymap.composer]` use the same string or object
shape, but each `keys` entry must be one key chord because composer commands run
immediately while text is being typed:

```toml
[keymap.composer]
OpenEditor = { keys = ["<C-o>"], description = "open editor" }
DeletePreviousWord = "<A-backspace>"
```

Direct `[keymap]` actions and `leader` cannot use reserved keys: `Enter`, `Esc`,
`Backspace`, `Delete`, `Ctrl+c`, `Ctrl+n`, or `Ctrl+p`. Invalid, reserved, or
conflicting bindings are ignored for that action. `[keymap.composer]` is separate
and can remap those editing keys. `Ctrl+n` and `Ctrl+p` always move row
selection down and up.

## Directly assignable actions

These action names can be assigned directly under `[keymap]`. Defaults
that start with `<leader>` are shown without the leading `Space` in the leader
popup. `OpenDisplayOptions`, `OpenComposerOptions`, `OpenNotificationOptions`,
and `OpenVoiceOptions` have contextual defaults inside the Options popup, so
assign your own full sequence if you want direct keys for them.

## Composer actions

These action names can be assigned under `[keymap.composer]`. Configured keys
replace that action's defaults. Any printable single character can be configured,
but that key will run the composer action instead of inserting text.

| Composer action        | Default config                            | Action                               |

## Focused pane actions

`OpenFocusedPaneAction` opens the action menu for the pane that currently has
focus. Server, channel, message, and member pane actions can be configured in
scoped tables. Focused-pane action menus keep their actions visible, and actions
that do not apply to the current selection are shown dimmed and disabled.

Server pane actions:

```toml
[keymap.guild_actions]
MarkAsRead = { keys = ["m"], description = "mark server as read" }
MuteServer = { keys = ["u"], description = "mute server" }
LeaveServer = { keys = ["l"], description = "leave server" }
```

| Scoped action | Default | Action                                                                     |

```

| Scoped action        | Default | Action                                                                                      |

| `MarkAsRead`         | `m`     | Mark the selected channel read.                                                             |
| `MuteChannel`        | `u`     | Mute or unmute the selected channel or category. Also accepts `ToggleMute` as an alias.     |

Member pane actions:

```toml
[keymap.member_actions]
ShowProfile = { keys = ["p"], description = "show profile" }
```

| Scoped action | Default | Action                              |
| ------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `ShowProfile` | `p`     | Open the selected member's profile. |

Message pane actions:

```toml

EditMessage = "e"
OpenMessageUrl = "o"
ViewMessageAttachment = "v"
GoToReferencedMessage = "g"
ShowMessageProfile = "p"
PinMessage = "P"
OpenThread = "t"
ShowReactionUsers = "u"
OpenPollVotePicker = "c"
```

| Scoped action           | Default | Action                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `CopyMessage`           | `y`     | Copy selected message content.                  |
| `ReactMessage`          | `r`     | Add or remove a reaction.                       |
| `ReplyMessage`          | `R`     | Start a reply.                                  |
| `DeleteMessage`         | `d`     | Open delete confirmation.                       |
| `EditMessage`           | `e`     | Start editing the selected message.             |
| `OpenMessageUrl`        | `o`     | Open the selected message URL.                  |
| `ViewMessageAttachment` | `v`     | Open the selected message attachment viewer.    |
| `GoToReferencedMessage` | `g`     | Go to the replied or forwarded message.         |
| `ShowMessageProfile`    | `p`     | Open the selected message author's profile.     |
| `PinMessage`            | `P`     | Open pin or unpin confirmation.                 |
| `OpenThread`            | `t`     | Open the selected message's thread.             |
| `ShowReactionUsers`     | `u`     | Show users who reacted to the selected message. |
| `OpenPollVotePicker`    | `c`     | Choose poll votes for the selected message.     |

Direct `[keymap]` message action bindings are separate. For example,
`GoToReferencedMessage = "gd"` under `[keymap]` makes `gd` work directly from the
Messages pane, while `[keymap.message_actions] GoToReferencedMessage = "g"`
controls the action menu shortcut.

Scoped action `description` changes the label shown in server, channel, and
message, and member action menus. Multiple configured `keys` work as aliases
when they are unique in the current action menu, and the popup shows them
together, such as `[x/u]`. If two actions in the same menu use the same
